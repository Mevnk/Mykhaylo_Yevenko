In order to test Dropbox API you will need your an access token.
I can't provide it in code or in the readme file, it will be revoked the moment the changes are published on GitHub.
Create your own DropBox App and generate a token or use the one I provide in the Google Classroom comment. 

Run: "python main.py --access-token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>"
